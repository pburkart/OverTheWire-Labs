# Bandit

## Bandit 0

Upon initially starting off with Bandit labs all you will need
to do is connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org via SSH on port
2220 with the username and password Bandit0. Once you do this
there will be a single file at the ~ directory called 'readme'.
This file contains the "flag" for the level, which acts as the 
password for Bandit 1.
